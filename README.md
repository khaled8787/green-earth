## What is the difference between var, let, and const?

## ans : 
var - A variable is only available within the function in which it is declared, and the same variable can be declared multiple times in the same scope with a variable.

let - let is limited to a block and variables with the same name cannot be declared with let in the same scope.

const - The value of a variable declared with const can never be changed. However, if the value is an object or an array, then its internal value can be changed.
